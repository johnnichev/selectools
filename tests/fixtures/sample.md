# Machine Learning Overview

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves. The primary aim is to allow computers to learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.

## Types of Machine Learning

### 1. Supervised Learning
The algorithm learns from labeled training data and makes predictions based on that data. Examples include:
- Classification
- Regression
- Forecasting

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
The algorithm finds patterns in unlabeled data. Common techniques:
- Clustering
- Dimensionality reduction
- Association rule learning

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
The algorithm learns through trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties for actions taken.

## Applications

Machine learning has numerous practical applications:

- **Healthcare**: Disease diagnosis, drug discovery
- **Finance**: Fraud detection, algorithmic trading
- **E-commerce**: Recommendation systems, price optimization
- **Transportation**: Autonomous vehicles, route optimization
- **Natural Language Processing**: Chatbots, translation services

## Popular Frameworks

1. **TensorFlow** - Google's open-source platform
2. **PyTorch** - Facebook's deep learning framework
3. **Scikit-learn** - Simple and efficient tools for data mining
4. **Keras** - High-level neural networks API

## Conclusion

Machine learning continues to evolve and transform industries. As computing power increases and more data becomes available, the potential applications of machine learning continue to expand.
